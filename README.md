Replication material for the paper "The Impact of Corona Populism: Empirical Evidence from Austria and Theory" by Patrick Mellacher, published in the Journal of Economic Behavior and Organization https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jebo.2023.02.021

Replication instructions:
In order to replicate the first empirical section (individual-level panel evidence), please first download the SUF edition of the Austrian Corona Panel Project ( https://data.aussda.at/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.11587/28KQNS ) and then run "individual level panel replication.R"

To replicate the second empirical section (aggregate-level evidence), you first need to conduct the previous step. Then, please download the .csv files and run aggregate level replication.R

To replicate the individual-level findings regarding the dark figure, please first apply for and download the SUF edition of the Covid-19 prevalence study conducted in November 2020 ( https://data.aussda.at/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.11587/G3C2CS ) and then run "dark figure replication.R"

To replicate the simulation results, please run "SIR homogenous mixing replication.R", and "SIR proportional mixing replication.R" and "SIR homophilic mixing replication.R" respectively.
